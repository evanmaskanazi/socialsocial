<!-- PL410 LINK2 FIX: Fixed magic link consent flow - new accounts now properly show consent modal -->

<!-- PL408: Added data-i18n-placeholder to followSearchInput and inviteSearchInput -->
<!-- TheraSocial Version PL407 SCREEN FIX v808 -->

<!-- PL407 SCREEN FIX v808: Now handles ?view=invite, ?view=following, etc. from /parameters page -->
<!-- PL407 SCREEN FIX: Fixed view navigation issue where Home showed with Invite/Following -->

<!-- PL407 SCREEN FIX: Enhanced sidebar-item handler with same robust view hiding approach -->
<!-- PL407 SCREEN FIX: Added inline style display:none as backup to .hidden class -->

<!-- PL405: Database migration fix for GDPR privacy columns -->
<!-- PL400: GDPR / Israeli Privacy Protection Law / US Security Compliance Update -->
<!-- PL400: Cookie consent banner for GDPR/ePrivacy compliance -->
<!-- PL400: Privacy dashboard UI for data transparency -->
<!-- PL400: Enhanced consent management with granular controls -->
<!-- PL400: Privacy region selection for applicable law determination -->
<!-- PL400: Data processing transparency disclosures -->
<!-- P315: Reverted to P204 approach - NO emojis in HTML options, feed-updates.js adds them dynamically -->

<!-- P307: Fixed diary layering bug - removed duplicate static calendar from trackingView -->
<!-- P306: Fixed feed loading in Home view -->
<!-- P305: MAJOR REDESIGN - Navigation restructure + Visual design overhaul -->
<!-- P305: CHANGE 1 - Feed becomes Home page with Welcome/Mission section above Feed content -->
<!-- P305: CHANGE 1 - New Progress tab with Location Settings and Your Progress sections -->
<!-- P305: CHANGE 2 - New calming color palette: #6B8BA4, #AFC7D6, #9DB8A0, #C7D9CC, #B6A9C9, #F4F1EC, #E8E1D9, #E5E5E3 -->
<!-- P305: CHANGE 2 - Wide and open layout with increased spacing and padding -->
<!-- P305: CHANGE 2 - Dark mode support for evening/nighttime use -->
<!-- P103: TOUR MODAL CENTERING FIX - Uses transform offset correction -->
<!-- P103: PROBLEM - When html dir="rtl", browser interprets CSS 'left' from right side -->
<!-- P103: SOLUTION - Set left:0, measure actual position, calculate offset, use transform to correct -->
<!-- P103: This is a standard browser quirk workaround, adapts dynamically to any screen size -->
<!-- P101: DUAL SAFEGUARD LANGUAGE FIX - Both index.html AND parameters-social.js enforce backend as source of truth -->
<!-- P101: setupLanguageSelector in parameters-social.js now fetches backend language first -->
<!-- P101: Blocks suspicious non-user-initiated language changes in parameters-social.js -->
<!-- P98/P99: Previous fixes maintained: PRE-FETCH backend source of truth, navbar responsive -->
<!-- FIX 1: loadUserLanguage NO LONGER overwrites backend - backend is SOURCE OF TRUTH -->
<!-- FIX 2: Removed "preserve pre-login language" logic that was incorrectly updating backend -->
<!-- FIX 3: Tour box now uses calc(50% - width/2) for guaranteed centering at all widths -->
<!-- FIX 4: Modal max-width reduced for screens under 360px -->
<!-- P97: FIXED MODAL CENTERING + LARGER HEBREW BUTTONS + LANGUAGE PERSISTENCE -->
<!-- Previous fixes: Modal RTL centering, Hebrew nav sizing, justLoggedIn flag -->
<!-- PI506: FIXED TUTORIAL HIGHLIGHT CLEANUP -->
<!-- FIX: Sidebar text no longer disappears during/after tutorial -->
<!-- FIX: highlightElement now properly cleans up all inline styles -->
<!-- FIX: Used data-view selectors instead of nth-child for reliability -->
<!-- FIX 1: Desktop sidebar now shows icons matching mobile navigation (separate icon spans) -->
<!-- FIX 2: Tutorial button added between language selector and logout button -->
<!-- FIX 3: Tutorial uses current language selection when started -->
<!-- FIX 4: Added onboarding translations for all 4 languages (en, he, ar, ru) -->
<!-- FIX 5: Added /api/onboarding/restart endpoint for tutorial button -->
<!-- PI502: PROPER TWO-MODE SYSTEM for trigger alert emails -->
<!-- Mode 1 "new_alerts_only": NO emails from scheduler, only via job queue when watched user saves new data -->
<!-- Mode 2 "daily_reminder": ONE email per day at DAILY_REMINDER_HOUR_UTC with all patterns -->
<!-- This properly prevents daily spam while still allowing daily digest option -->
<!-- PJ40F v2017: FIX - Followlog highlight now persists using sessionStorage -->
<!-- Problem: Highlight was disappearing because loadFollowing() called multiple times -->
<!-- Solution: Store highlight in sessionStorage, only clear on follow/navigate away/logout -->
<!-- PJ40F: FOLLOWLOG INVITE LINK FEATURE -->
<!-- Invite page (/invite/{username}) now shows only one Follow button (no Dashboard button) -->
<!-- Page looks identical whether logged in or logged out -->
<!-- Follow button links to /followlog/{username} which handles redirect logic: -->
<!--   If logged in: redirects to Following tab with invited user highlighted at top -->
<!--   If not logged in: saves target to session, redirects to login, then to Following tab -->
<!-- Frontend handles highlighting invited user with special styling in recommendations -->
<!-- PJ6019: DUPLICATE TRIGGER FIX -->
<!-- Backend fix - trigger updates now UPDATE existing triggers instead of creating duplicates -->
<!-- Also all trigger queries now filter by is_active=True so deleted triggers stop firing -->
<!-- After deploying, call POST /api/admin/cleanup-duplicate-triggers to remove existing duplicates -->
<!-- PJ6018: ALERT EMAIL MODE CONFIGURATION -->
<!-- Alert behavior is controlled by ALERT_EMAIL_MODE constant in backend (appchoice.py) -->
<!-- Two modes available: -->
<!--   "new_alerts_only" - Only email for NEW patterns never seen before -->
<!--   "daily_reminder" - Re-email every time watched user saves (after 24hr window) -->
<!-- To change mode: Edit ALERT_EMAIL_MODE in appchoice.py near top of file -->
<!-- PJ40E: THREE FIXES (NO CHANGES TO /parameters route) -->
<!-- FIX 1: Daily reminder email link now works correctly for logged-in AND logged-out users -->
<!--        Created NEW route /diary-redirect that handles the login check -->
<!--        If logged in → redirects to /parameters (diary page) -->
<!--        If not logged in → redirects to / (login page) -->
<!--        Email link changed from /parameters to /diary-redirect -->
<!--        /parameters route is COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED -->
<!-- FIX 2: Birth year now displayed when viewing another user's profile -->
<!--        Backend now includes birth_year in /api/users/<id>/profile response -->
<!-- FIX 3: Fixed timezone mapping for all valid cities (including "Chicago, USA" etc.) -->
<!--        Added full city names with countries to CITY_TIMEZONE_MAP -->
<!-- PJ6014: MULTIPLE FIXES -->
<!-- FIX 1: Search results in Circles/Following/Invite now show mutual connection & same city instead of email -->
<!-- FIX 2: "Recommended for You" and "Suggested People to Invite" now show mutual/city reason -->
<!-- FIX 3: Birth Year Update button only visible on OWN profile, hidden when viewing others -->
<!-- PJ6013: Mobile notification toggles now load correctly from backend -->
<!-- PJ6012: Consolidated batch emails now sent from TRIGGER SCHEDULER path -->
<!-- PJ6011: Backend fix - Trigger alerts no longer send individual emails, only consolidated batch emails -->
<!-- PJ6010: MOBILE FIX - About and Support links now visible on mobile -->
<!-- ROOT CAUSE: .nav-link had display:none in @media max-width:768px, hiding About/Support buttons -->
<!-- FIX: Changed .nav-link from display:none to display:inline-block with responsive sizing -->
<!-- PJ5002: Mobile Navigation Consolidation - 10 tabs reduced to 5 -->
<!-- ROOT CAUSE: Too many tabs (10) on mobile made navigation confusing and touch targets too small -->
<!-- FIX 1: Consolidated into 5 primary tabs: Home, Feed, Diary, Messages, More -->
<!-- FIX 2: Fixed Feed icon from 🏠 to 📝 (journal/post icon) -->
<!-- FIX 3: Added proper Home tab with 🏠 icon for dashboard/progress page -->
<!-- FIX 4: Created "More" slide-up menu containing: Profile, Circles, Social section (Following/Followers/Invite), Alerts -->
<!-- FIX 5: Alert badge now shows on both main nav "More" button and inside More menu on Alerts item -->
<!-- FIX 6: More menu follows iOS/Android bottom sheet UX pattern -->
<!-- PJ5001: CRITICAL FIX - Mobile Alerts View -->
<!-- ROOT CAUSE: .right-sidebar was hidden on mobile (display:none in @media max-width:768px) -->
<!-- This caused ALL alerts to be invisible on iPhone and similar small screens -->
<!-- FIX 1: Added dedicated Alerts tab to mobile navigation bar -->
<!-- FIX 2: Created alertsView section with mobile-optimized layout -->
<!-- FIX 3: loadAlerts() now populates both desktop and mobile alert lists -->
<!-- FIX 4: dismissAlert() syncs removal between desktop and mobile lists -->
<!-- FIX 5: Added mobile alerts badge showing unread count -->
<!-- FIX 6: Added syncMobileNotificationSettings() for toggle sync -->
<!-- PJ816: CRITICAL FIX - Trigger alert emails now sent WITHOUT requiring watcher login -->
<!-- ROOT CAUSE: check_parameter_triggers() required @login_required and only ran on polling -->
<!-- Emails were only sent when the WATCHER logged in, not when WATCHED user's data triggered -->
<!-- FIX 1: Added background trigger scheduler that runs every 5 minutes -->
<!-- FIX 2: New function run_background_trigger_check_for_watcher() processes all triggers -->
<!-- FIX 3: Emails sent automatically when trigger conditions are met (like message notifications) -->
<!-- PJ815: CRITICAL FIX - Reverted broken v1704 trigger deduplication -->
<!-- ROOT CAUSE: v1704 merged triggers upfront, losing all parameter flags (mood_alert, etc.) -->
<!-- Because triggers use OLD schema (parameter_name) not NEW schema flags, bool(None)=False broke everything -->
<!-- FIX 1: Process each trigger row individually - no upfront deduplication -->
<!-- FIX 2: Use patterns_seen SET to deduplicate RESULTS not inputs -->
<!-- FIX 3: Each trigger checked for its actual schema (old vs new) and processed accordingly -->
<!-- Added extensive [PJ815 DEBUG] and [PJ815 PATTERN] logging for diagnostics -->
<!-- PJ813: Fixed trigger alerts - each date range creates separate alert, all patterns found -->
<!-- Features: User Blocking with Toggle, Diary Reminder 24hr Time, Fixed Circle Recommendations, Improved Login Form -->
<!-- PJ501 Changes: Fixed block message to "Account Not Available", Fixed Block button translation, Added recommended user profile preview -->
<!-- PJ601 Changes: Block/Unblock toggle button fix in Following and Profile views, Fixed Follow button width, Fixed navigation loop after 403 on Circles/Feed -->
<!-- PJ602 Changes: Fixed Follow button width (override CSS width:100%), Fixed action buttons persisting on own profile, Fixed double 403 message on Circles -->
<!-- PJ701 Changes: Fixed HTML/CSS security - added escapeHtml for user input in innerHTML to prevent XSS attacks -->
<!-- PJ702 Changes: 
     1. Fixed Add to Circle button - now checks if user is already in circles before showing
     2. Fixed Following search Block button - now has Block/Unblock toggle functionality  
     3. Added clickable names in Invite tab Suggested People section
     4. Added search bar to Invite tab with Send Request button
-->
<!-- PJ703 Changes:
     1. Fixed Block button showing "following.block" - changed to use correct translation key "block.block_user"
     2. Fixed Followers tab profile viewing - now works same as Following tab with preview mode
     3. Fixed Invite section follow status - now always checks actual following status via API
-->
<!-- PJ704 Changes:
     1. Backend fix - Alerts for new followers, invites, and messages were being incorrectly filtered out
     2. The get_alerts endpoint was filtering ALL alerts with source_user_id by following status
     3. Now only 'trigger' and 'feed' category alerts are filtered - follow/invite/message alerts always show

     2. Fixed Followers tab - clicking on user names now works same as Following tab (uses viewUserProfileFromFollowers)
     3. Fixed Invite section follow tracking - now properly shows Unfollow when already following a user
-->
<!-- PJ801 Changes:
     1. Fixed circle restriction message persisting after navigating away
     2. When viewing another user's private circles and then going back to own circles,
        the yellow "Restricted Access" box was not being cleared
     3. Added 'circle-restriction-message' class to restriction message div
     4. Updated clearViewActionButtons to also remove restriction messages
     5. Added explicit removal in loadCircles for safety
-->
<!-- PJ806 Changes:
     1. CRITICAL BUG FIX: Fixed repeated email spam from trigger alerts
     2. The /api/parameters/check-triggers endpoint no longer creates alerts (READ-ONLY)
     3. Alerts are now only created when parameters are saved (via process_parameter_triggers)
-->
<!-- PJ807 Changes:
     1. Backend: Reduced duplicate detection window from 7 days to 1 day
     2. Backend: Added comprehensive logging for process_parameter_triggers debugging
     3. Frontend: Fixed JavaScript error in displayParameterAlerts for old schema alerts
-->
<!-- PJ808 Changes:
     1. Backend: REMOVED 24-hour cooldown that was blocking ALL legitimate alerts
-->
<!-- PJ809 Changes (version 1500):
     1. Backend: Enhanced logging for save_parameters function
     2. Backend: Reduced duplicate detection window from 1 day to 4 hours
     3. This allows more frequent alerts while still preventing spam
-->
<!-- PJ811 Changes (version 1700):
     1. CRITICAL FIX: Trigger alerts now persist in database and don't vanish
     2. Backend: check_parameter_triggers now creates database alerts with 24hr duplicate detection
     3. Backend: Emails are sent when trigger alerts are created (if email_on_alert enabled)
     4. Frontend: No longer adds ephemeral DOM alerts that disappear on refresh
     5. Frontend: loadAlerts() fetches persistent alerts from /api/alerts
     6. Added comprehensive logging: [TRIGGER CHECK], [TRIGGER CREATE], [TRIGGER DUPLICATE], [TRIGGER EMAIL]
-->
<!-- PJ812 Changes (version 1701):
     1. FIX: Frontend now calls checkParameterAlerts() after login completes (3 second delay)
     2. FIX: checkParameterAlerts checks if user is logged in before making API call
     3. FIX: Backend formats dates nicely (e.g., "Dec 05 - Dec 07") instead of ISO format
     4. This ensures trigger checks happen when user is authenticated, not just on page load
-->
<!-- PJ812 Changes (version 1702):
     1. FIX: Double message on Enter key - improved debouncing with multiple prevention layers
     2. FIX: Added 1-second time-based debounce between messages
     3. FIX: Clear input immediately before async send to prevent re-sending
     4. FIX: Using keydown instead of keypress for reliable Enter detection
     5. FIX: Increased alerts-list max-height to 600px for more alerts visibility
     6. BACKEND: Increased alerts limit from 50 to 100 for full month of alerts
     7. BACKEND: process_parameter_triggers now includes privacy checks (matching check_triggers)
     8. BACKEND: Trigger emails now sent when watched user saves parameters (no login required)

                    The primary team behind this is CEO Benny Brandstetter and CTO Evan Askanazi.

                    Thera Social was created for those who feel disconnected, struggling, or unseen. War veterans carrying invisible wounds, young adults navigating isolation, survivors of trauma and abuse, students overwhelmed by pressure—all deserve genuine connection and support, not just another feed of curated highlights.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;" data-i18n="about.story_para2">
                    Current social media platforms have failed us. They amplify comparison, enable harassment, and leave the vulnerable more isolated than before. We need something fundamentally different.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;" data-i18n="about.story_para3">
                    That's why we built Thera Social. This platform offers real community support through complete anonymity and customizable trust circles. Share your feelings, track what matters (sleep, mood, health, exercise), and receive alerts on trends in people you care about—all while choosing exactly who sees what. Thera Social isn't designed for endless selfies or internet arguments—it's built for mutual care, authentic check-ins through private messaging, and the meaningful support we all need.
